The cut values are selected by the same variables as for two body decays.
It uses the same FindV0 procedure as 2D decays=>uses the same cuts
the mother kaon matching is controled by
KFParticleFinder::SetChi2Cut2D(float cut)       { fCuts2D[1] = cut; } ///< Sets cut on \f$\chi^2_{geo}\f$ for 2-daughter decays.

!!!
There is a different hardwired settings for fixed target a collider mode
marked by "TODO FXT" in StKFParticleInterface.cxx

The code aby defaulta uses PID for kaon candidates:
1. There is "softmode" for TOF - set in muAnalysis.C
   StKFParticleInterface::instance()->SetSoftKaonPIDMode();
      for pions:
         StKFParticleInterface::instance()->SetSoftTofPidMode();
         2. Even if off it still uses dE/dx
            This needs to be manually commented out in ::GetPID
            
            In order to run on simulation one needs to set in muAnalysis.C
               kfpAnalysis->ProcessSignal();
               
               
When runing on simulation one has to enable  kfpAnalysis->ProcessSignal(); in muAnalysis.C
and vice versa !

in muAnlysis.C is setup ry2016, picoEvt  ....is this a problem on run19 data?
